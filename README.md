# Breast Cancer Malignant-Benign Classification


## Context

October is the breast cancer awareness month. 
Breast cancer is a major public health issue. It was responsible for 685000 deaths around the globe in 2020 (WHO: https://www.who.int/fr/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer). Half of the breast cancer cases in women appear without any risk factor other than sex and age. About 0.5-1% of breast cancers appear in men.
It is thus interesting to find new ways to detect breast cancer, especially at early stages when the disease can be treated with efficacity. We can consider tumor characteristics obtained through X-ray.

Starting from the Breast Cancer Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset), the goal is to classify samples as:
- *Malignant*: the tumor is cancerous, which means that it grows quickly, often invade surrounding tissues and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)
- *Benign*: the tumor is not cancerous, which means that it grows slowly with distinct borders, it does not invade surrounding tissues and does not spread to other parts of the body
